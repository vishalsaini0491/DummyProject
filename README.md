# DummyProject
This project is a basic application prototype designed to help interns understand core app development workflows. It integrates OpenAI's API for intelligent query response functionality and includes two key features:

Notifications: Real-time or local notification functionality to alert users.

Calendar Integration: A UI-based calendar feature that syncs with the device or third-party calendar systems.

Key Features:

Text input for user queries with responses generated via OpenAI's API

Notification feature (e.g., reminders or alerts)

Calendar integration (Google Calendar API or device calendar, depending on platform)

Modular code architecture for clarity and scalability

Tech Stack (suggested):

Frontend: React or React Native

Backend (if applicable): Node.js/Express or serverless functions

OpenAI API: For intelligent responses

Notifications: Local (for web or mobile), push if youâ€™re advanced

Calendar API: Google Calendar API or a calendar component (like FullCalendar for web)
